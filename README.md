# DM_Challenge

This github repository contains some of the code used for the analysis of the paper "Human-AI Collaborative Decision Making for
Screening Mammography" by Ahsen et. al. 
We have used R programming language for this.

## Simulated Data
There are two files. The first file contains named `functions_simulated.R` the manual functions needed to run the analysis for the simulated data. This needs to be sourced for the analysis. The second file named `simulated.R` contains the analysis which can be used for creating figures as in Figure 1 in the paper.

## Dream Data
Unfortunately, we can not share the dream data as used in the manuscript. However, upon request we can share a simulated data that is shaped similarly to the dream data used in the paper. Contact: ahsen@illinois.edu
